                <h2>What is a temple?</h2>
                <p>The temple here i am refering to is your body!! I know your temple needs a good renovation and thats where WorkIN & OUT comes in the picture.Here we not only give the tricks and tips to renovate your "Temple", we also help the soul to be the better version of itself aka "Monks".</p>
                <p>There are many health advantages of going to the gym, yoga poses as well as meditation which I do on a regular basis.

                    Seems like much of India doesn’t do it which is what prompted me to answer this. While Modi Ji is promoting Yoga at G20 in Argentina as India’s answer to all health problems in the world, many Indians don’t seem to be practicing it even though they go out and vote in huge numbers for Modi Ji/BJP.
                    
                    As per a recent survey, 71% Indians have poor muscle health which is clear indication that Indians don’t care enough about their own health. <br>
                    
                    <h4>The advantages of Renovating your "Temple":-</h4><br>
                    1)Physical exercise is good for your muscles and bones. <br>
                    2)Physical activity paired with adequate protein intake will lead to muscle building. <br>
                    3)It can increase energy levels throughout the day. <br>
                    4)As per a study, just six weeks of regular exercise reduced fatigue level for people who had reported persistent fatigue. <br> 
                    5)Lack of regular physical exercise is a cause of chronic disease. So hitting the gym can reduce possibility of getting chronic diseases. <br>
                    6)Exercise stimulates blood flow and induce skin cell adaptations which makes your skin clear and reduce aging. <br>
                    7)Exercise directly results in improvement in brain power and memory. <br>
                    8) Physical activity promotes flow of blood and oxygen into the brain resulting in higher memory and sharper brain. <br>
                    9)Regular exercise can help you relax and sleep better. <br>
                    10)Exercise can help with weight loss in case that is a problem which you are dealing with.</p>
